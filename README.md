## Installation

Make sure you have a `start` directory for your vim plugins. Run the following command to create it if you don't: 

`mkdir -p ~/vim/pack/default/start` 

Or, if you're one of those new-fangled **neovim** users: 

`mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/default/start` 

Now, change directories to your new `start` directory and clone this repo: 

`cd ~/vim/pack/default/start && git clone https://github.com/rav3ndust/vim-solidity` 

That's it! Plugins you place in your `start` directory are loaded automatically when vim initializes, so you don't need to worry about adding extra stuff to your .vimrc file. 

## What About Vim Plugin Managers? 

I don't use these, so I'm not as familiar with them. Follow the same process for this plugin as you do for others, but as I have not messed with them and am not interested to, consider this unsupported and try it out if you'd like. _YMMV_. 

## Credits

This repo is a fork of [tomlion's repository](https://github.com/tomlion/vim-solidity). 

The original repo hasn't seen activity in a number of years, so I hope to help keep it around and update it from time to time for the benefit of myself and other Solidity vim programmers.
